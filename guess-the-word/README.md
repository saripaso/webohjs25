# About Guess the Word -game
The game was developed by Sari Paso in October 2025. It was made as a school assignment for a course at Oulu University of Applied Sciences.

# How to play
The player can try to guess a coding-related word by clicking the letter keys. If the guesses are wrong, strikes go up to six before the game is lost. The game can be played by downloading all the files and opening the index.html file locally on a web browser.

# AI and resources
The code was developed without the use of AI, but with the use of reading many Stack Overflow posts and other articles.
